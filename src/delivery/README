The NIST Validator MS Windows executable is experimental software. 
It is available at http://syseng.nist.gov/se-interop/get-validator. 
I will try to update this code with every update of the server at syseng.nist.gov. 
If interest in this code develops, and time permits, I'll develop more automated
means to update the code, but for the time being, you should manually pick up
new executables with every announced enhancement. Enhancements are announced
on the  MIWG mailing list.
